I am making this read me file to further explain to the end user the significance of the user registration system.

You see, in short, it has absolutely no use! This is just me testing out concepts i've learnt already to further perfect them (assuming I don't get stuck at connecting to my remote github repo again).

Well then, lets go ahead and push this to the betaFeatures branch before merging with master, afterwhich I will go off to reward myself for the hardwork. 

The reward is not much, it'll just be me playing a harmless game of dream league soccer 2022. Well then...
